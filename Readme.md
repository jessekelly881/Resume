# My Resume and Coverletter
> A resume and cover letter built using LaTeX

Latex template is free to change, use, and share. But the text is mine.

*Resume*
![Resume](resume.jpg?raw=true "Resume Screenshot")

*Cover Letter*
![Cover Letter](cover.jpg?raw=true "Resume Screenshot")


## How to use

This project depends on LaTeX and make. Both of which I assume you already have installed. If so run

```
make
```

to build the project or

```
make dev
```

to rebuild the latex document after every change.

You *must* be on a linux or mac machine for this to work!
